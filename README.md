# update in 2023/5/20

I have finished the bug for importing component, it work well.

# vue3-drag-resize-rotate

this [repo](https://github.com/AvailableForTheWorld/vue3-drag-resize-rotate) is inspired by [link](https://github.com/minogin/vue-drag-resize-rotate), which is for vue2, so I really want to refresh it as vue3.

It is intended to cover the project for my company, I will try to make the component easy to use and make it flexible.

Then, I plan to develop it into a long-term program, gradually adding more features over time.

# simple technology stack

- vue3
- typescript

Just add nanoid for an extra package, and I will remove it subsequently.
